### Sprints

The project was developed over multiple sprints, each focusing on specific features and improvements.

### User Stories

- As a visitor, I want to view a list of projects so that I can understand the developer's capabilities.
- As a visitor, I want to see projects by category to find relevant examples.
- As a visitor, I want to contact the developer for collaboration opportunities.

## Scope Plane, Structural Plane, Skeleton and Surface Planes

### Scope Plane

The site includes project listings, an about section, and contact information.

### Structural Plane

- **Home Page**: Introduction and featured projects.
- **Projects Section**: Detailed list of all projects.
- **About Section**: Information about the developer.
- **Contact Section**: Information to reach out to the developer.

### Skeleton Plane

Wireframes were created to layout the structure of each page, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

### Surface Plane

The final design incorporates the chosen color scheme and typography to create a cohesive and visually appealing site.

## Feature Showcase

### Header/Navigation & Footer

A consistent header and footer are present on all pages, providing easy navigation and contact information.

### Home Page

Introduces the developer and highlights featured projects.

### Profile

The About page serves as the developer's profile.

## Future Development

- Implement search and filter functionality for projects.
- Add a blog section to share insights and tutorials.
- Integrate a contact form with backend processing for emails.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Python 3.13, Flask
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Surprise
- **Database**: None (CSV file used for project data)
- **Deployment**: Render

## Deployment

### Connecting to GitHub

The project is hosted on GitHub at [mahmudurmahid/python-project-portfolio](https://github.com/mahmudurmahid/python-project-portfolio).

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmudurmahid/python-project-portfolio.git
```

### Forking the Repository

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right.
3. Choose your GitHub account to fork the repository.

## AI Tools in Development

### Using AI to Assist in Code Creation

AI tools like GitHub Copilot were utilized to expedite coding tasks and provide suggestions. For example, boiler plate HTML code significantly reduced the amount of time spent creating this from scratch

### Using AI to Assist in Debugging

AI-assisted debugging helped identify and resolve issues efficiently. For example, ChatGPT helped resolve an error in project cards becoming smaller and smaller as you scroll down the page.

### Using AI to Optimize Code for Performance and UX

AI recommendations were considered to enhance performance and user experience. For example, Microsoft Co-Pilot and ChatGPT offered suggestions of color schemes representative of VS Code.

### Using AI to Create Automated Unit Tests

AI tools facilitated the generation of unit tests to ensure code reliability. For example, Co-Pilot was used to make sure no missing tags or additional tags were present on HTML pages.

### Reflection on AI‚Äôs Role in the Development Process

AI tools significantly streamlined the development process, offering valuable insights and reducing development time. Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to create boiler plate html code, for example. Without the use of AI, I suspect this project would have taken at least two days more to produce if I used other resources/tools like Stack Overflow

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

User stories were manually tested to ensure the site meets user expectations.

### Device Testing

The site was tested on various devices to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.

### Browser Compatibility

Tested on major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari for consistent performance.

### Accessibility

Implemented semantic HTML and ARIA labels to enhance accessibility.

### Solved Bugs

- Fixed navigation issues on mobile devices.
- Resolved styling inconsistencies across pages.
- Frontend and Backend Languages not appearing on project modal
- Project cards appearing smaller and smaller as you scroll down the page

### Known Bugs

- None identified at this time.

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and inspiration. From creating the projects displayed on the website and the various resources I used for these, implementing Flask and the use of python3.13 was much easier than before I created the first project on this site.
